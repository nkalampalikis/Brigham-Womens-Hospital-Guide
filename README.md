# Hospital-Guide
A complete Java application with a GUl in FXML. The application includes features such as path finding and service requests.

Project Overview
For this B-term session of CS-3733: Software Engineering, Team F was tasked with the creation of a robust and, attractive, kiosk-style, pathfinding application for Brigham & Womenâ€™s Hospital. The goal for the final project was to have an easy to use application that would allow users to navigate around the hospital, send service requests, accept service requests, manage the users, and various other beneficial functions.  Over the course of the term the team created multiple iterations of the project, each time expanding the functionality and  improving the quality of their product. 
For the first iteration the team was to create a basic functional model, and learn the ropes with regards to the formal and practical aspects of Agile software development. For this particular iteration, the team was very successful in creating a basic functional model and presenting it to the class, even winning some of the bonus points from Professor Wong.
For the second iteration, the team sought to build upon its strong start with several ambitious goals. Unfortunately, the team encountered several serious issues with merge errors, and a team conduct issue, all of which contributed to the team struggling with this iteration. The team ended up suffering in its performance, but managed to get second best feature.
Motivated by a lackluster second iteration, the team was freshly motivated to perform better on the third iteration. The team put forth significant effort to ensure that our iteration three product would be of the highest quality, extensively refactoring our code and greatly increasing functionality. Once again the team hit some bad luck, and a somewhat disastrous presentation for Iteration Three, which the team was able to somewhat able to recover from mid-presentation. 
The team was mortified with the results of the presentation for Iteration three, and was deeply motivated to create an excellent final product, and present it perfectly. The main focus for the final iteration was to create a very robust and polished product. The team set strict rules, so as to avoid the over-ambitiousness and bugs that plagued our second and third iterations, and hopefully produce a final product representative of the sum of our efforts over the course of the term.
The team feels strongly that it has created an excellent final product, regardless of the major hiccups that were encountered in iterations two and three. Many hours were spent on each aspect of the final product, ensuring that it was both of the highest quality and reliability that we could produce.
